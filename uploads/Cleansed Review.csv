Review
"I stayed 2 nights at this hotel in superior room with balcony in old part of hotel. Room was space, nice, very clean, with no dust. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was clean, nice, with marble.WiFi was free.Stuff was very friendly, professional, and helpful. It seems they enjoy their work. Check in and out were quick and without any problems. I have only breakfast. It was great- a lot of choice, delicious food. Cook made fresh waffles and pancakes. There was also food for people who have diabetes. They also have their one wine cellar. There was nothing to complain. I think it deserve 5*."
"Amazing hotel! Very clean, modern, excellent service, spa and pool! Rooms are super big, with a big and clean bathroom! Wifi connection works very well! Just the breakfast could be a bit better...moreover I've found a fantastic offer and I've paid for 1 night just 70 €!!!!"
"Rooms are great, very well equiped, confortable bed, service is very good, food is very good. I had also an amazing view from balcony. I had a pleasant stay there aldought it was December and not much to do"
"We had a short stay at Kempinski palace Portorož and it was excelent! Delux room was great, breakfast to die for and spa experience was fabulous! Reception staff is kind and welcoming, valet service efficient. The best hotel in Slovenia! We will be back!"
"Beautiful hotel, great relaxing atmosphere in the piano bar. Breakfast was amazing and the prosecco added to that luxury feeling. The room was clean and comfortable. We had one night in this hotel but we could have stayed longer. Value for money!"
"The hotel had nice rooms. We had a sea view room. There was noise (music) from the nearby cafe or a discotheque until quite late. No response from the hotel when we complained about it.The pool has sea water, which is nice. The saunas are not bad as well.The breakfast was ok.The service was hit and miss, even though it was clear that people were trying. No desire to return albeit for visiting nearby Trieste, Croatia and Slovenia are probably better options esp. off-peak season. Expensive parking."
"Stayed with my wife and two young children in September on a 10 week tour of Europe. Modern hotel with very good facilities. Rooms were spacious and modern. I would probably call it a business hotel as it has large conference facilities, etc., which could mean it might get rather crowded, but when we were there it was fully booked and it did not feel crowded. Good spa with nice indoor and outdoor pool. Good location in the middle of Portoroz and just a 5 minute drive from beautiful Piran. We stayed here instead of Piran because we wanted the full set of amenities. We felt it was good value for a business 5 star hotel. The one negative was the large breakfast room which was a rather manic and crowded."
"We stayed in Portoroz in October with family. The hotel has a modern and a classical part, we stayed in the modern part, 3rd floor, partial seaview, big balcony. Well, this is a 5 star Kempinski, so we were absolutely satisfied with the room and everything. Didn't try the outside pool, because it was cold or closed at this time of the year. Pool area and spa is nothing special for me. Breakfast in the ballroom is very nice, looking at the garden area, a big plus for the breakfast till noon. Parking fee is a little expensive. Staff was helpful. The location is fantastic, Portoroz & Piran are beautiful, I loved the seaside, even though we were out of season, so didn't swim in the sea."
"We will return to this magnificent palace with an amazing SPA ...we loved breakfast until 12 in the amazing Crystall Hall as well as our deluxe room on the top floor with delightful sea view.Very affordable Kempinski to return to, friendly and professional staff"
"nothing else to say just perfect. reception and concierge amazing, restaurant and bar very good, room and the hotel in general 5*. The concierge organized us a hunting within 15 min drive from the hotel an dit was realy great!"
"Spent a week in Portorose in Kepminski for business. Price was excellent due to low season including breakfast. I enjoyed mostly breakfast in the spectacular ballroom. The quality and variety of breakfast was impressive, many local products. Staff was super friendly and detail oriented. My room was superior, garden view with a balcony, spacious and modern. Bed was extreemly comfortable. The only negative is the indoor pool, although spacious the water was very cold. Also selection of food in the bar was scarse. I will return to this hotel."
"Quick business stay here for two days. I emailed the hotel and they arranged transportation for me to and from Trieste, Italy. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Rooms were nice - well appointed with a comfortable bed and pillows.Breakfast was good, with an excellent variety. Had some drinks and snacks in the bar, and the staff was great and friendly. Gave me a taste of the local liquor and didn't charge me. Quite nice!Only nit was that checkout can be tough if there is a group there. They have desks over a typical counter, so it takes longer. Plan accordingly if you are with a group."
I stayed over a weekend in the hotel. The hotel itself is great. I had a room without seaview but looked into the small hills. The spa area is great I took a massage which was great but with around 90€ quite expensive. Also the bar is very nice but cocktails are quite expensive. All in all a great hotel not cheap but the money is well spent
The rooms and the bathroom were very clean and nice ! The staff were very friendly and helpful ! Breakfast was good only aity the coffee was always cold ! Breakfast was served in a beautiful casle ballroom .
"Visited this hotel for a spcific purpose, a day of total break in low season. Could not have made a better choice, you feel spoiled and relaxed. Check in was quick, by an experienced and very professional lady - must have been a senior staff. Useful and gentle without overdoing it - just perfect. Overall excellent concierge and reception staff. Spent 2 days at the pool, fantastic. My only concern is here - service at the pool is sporadic, almost absent and not very helpful - did not help with towels and I had to convince them to call the reception for assistance since they could not help. My praise is for the cleaning lady at the pool who tried her best to assist even if it was not her duty, while the pool guy was a bit lost.The room was nice with an extremely comfortable bed. Breakfast is simply excellent and enjoyable on the terrace overlooking the beautiful garden - i would have expected warm dishes prepared on the spot - which were not available. If you are in Portoroz dont look for anything else, and enjoy this hotel."
